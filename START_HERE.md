## 🔄 Current Limitation & Solution

**Current State:**
- Admin panel works perfectly
- You can create posts easily
- Posts are saved to GitHub
- BUT: Blog page still shows static/placeholder posts

**The Solution:**
I need to update `blog.html` to dynamically load posts from the `blog-posts/` folder.

**Options:**
1. **Simple JavaScript** - Load posts dynamically (I can add this!)
2. **Static Site Generator** - Use 11ty or Hugo (more advanced)
3. **Manual for now** - Copy post content to blog.html cards

**Want me to add dynamic loading?** Just ask! It's a 30-minute update.
